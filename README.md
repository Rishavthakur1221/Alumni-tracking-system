# Alumni-tracking-system
It was a group based Project Which I , Ankush Aneja and 3 others Did in a Competetion Named as SIH (Smart Indian Hackathon) .
I was the team leader for the project And did The home page, and integration part along with Changing some user interface Of the project.
It was a problem statement given my the Govt. of goa that they were facing a problem that 10k students were passing out each year,
and they had no proper system to track there alumnies. So we took the job under our command and started building this project.
This project has the ability to not only track all the alumnies but also to interact with them via mail and SMS. Although It was a prototype so
Only the clg can search student and Broadcast there message to the students at once via SMS , we can append a group chat feature to it 
The major Downfall we can face is that if the Alumnies Dont update there profiles as it works on there Information feeded by them then the information 
will not be valide for that person.
Both students and clg can register there and track there Alumnies.
